## Outlier Desktop

Various features to make outlier.nyc useable on the Desktop

* Limits the width of the main content so main image doesn't take up 3 million scrolls
* Makes the feature image the background of product pages
* Makes the feature image smaller by limiting height
* Shows stock count of products (assume this will get broken at some point when they fix their stuff)
* Moves the menu to a top hoziontal view
* Clicking anywhere after opening the search will close the damn thing
* Dismantles the horizontal color carousel to show the color images in a desktop friendly grid
* Adds color swatch by the "Add to cart" table color names
